        Git Reset is a popular command that allows you to undo changes made in the working directory. There are two
        types of git reset: hard and soft.
        Git hard reset will rollback your changes as well as the commits that were made after those changes.
        Git soft reset : It is used when you want to discard your changes and go back to the last commit.
